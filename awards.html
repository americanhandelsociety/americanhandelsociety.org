          <h2>The J. Merrill Knapp Research Fellowship</h2>
          <p>The Board of Directors of The American Handel Society invites applications for the J. Merrill Knapp Research Fellowship to support scholarly projects related to Handel and his world. One or more fellowships may be awarded in a calendar year up to a total of $2,000.

This fellowship may be used on its own or to augment other grants or fellowships.</p>
